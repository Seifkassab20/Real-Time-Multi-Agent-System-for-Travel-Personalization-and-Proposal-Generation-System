  - Include location and intent when possible
  - Avoid vague phrases

  Example:

  ========================
  DATE & TIME REASONING (CRITICAL)
  ========================

  TODAY_DATE is provided below and MUST be used for all calculations.

  TODAY_DATE: {today}

  Rules:
  1. If no date or duration is mentioned, return empty date fields

  2. If the user mentions explicit dates:
  - Convert them to YYYY-MM-DD format
  - Use the correct year relative to TODAY_DATE

  3. If the user mentions RELATIVE dates:
  - "next week", "next month", "tomorrow", etc.
  - Calculate the exact date using TODAY_DATE

  4. If the user mentions STAY DURATION verbally:
  - Examples: "a week", "7 days", "15 days", "a month"
  - If a start date is mentioned:
      - check_out = check_in + duration
  - If no start date is mentioned:
      - check_in = TODAY_DATE (or calculated relative start)
      - check_out = check_in + duration

  5. Duration conversions:
  - "a week" = 7 days
  - "two weeks" = 14 days
  - "15 days" = 15 days
  - "a month" = 30 days

  ========================
  FINAL RULE
